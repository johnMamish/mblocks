Some steps need to be taken to set up this code

If you have the Arduino library freshly installed, you need to follow the instructions in the "ESP8266 Hookup Guide" by sparkfun in order to install the ESP8266 Arduino Addon.

Note: if you are using Linux, make sure that you don't use apt-get to install arduino ide.  It will install an out-of-date version.  You must do it from the official arduino website, www.arduino.cc/en/Main
